      Currently working  in the fields of Computer Vision , Deep learning , Machine learning , Data science  and  Web development which  includes technologies ike HTML,CSS and Javascript for the  front end developement and then node.js and further API developments for integration with the backend . After having good amount of experience in Python , and training models using custom built models using tensorflow , he is now focusing towards deployment of  the neural networks in the web browsers and the mobile applications . His main aim is to develop something for the development of human race , from which everyone is benefitted .
      For deploying the web based AI models he is currently working on Tensorflow.js and Tensorflow lite

        <h2> INTERNSHIP  </h2>
        <p>
            I have successfully completed  my internship at  IIT BOMBAY  in the field  of COMPUTER VISION :<br>
            Some Key takeaways from the project :

            <ul>
               <li>In the internship I worked on implemention of the semantic segmentation , and the panoptic segmentation for image understanding </li>

               <li>The second part of the project was to integrate a probability modelling to the image to get the rraltionship between the objects of the image</li>

               <li>For the purpose of semantic segmentation various models were made , like the UNET , semantic net , UNET3++ and the HALF UNET </li>

               <li>The next part after implementation of the semantic segmentation or the panoptic segmentation , the next part was for the human action detection  , as the human action determines , which object is highly related </li>
            </ul>
        </p>

                        <li>
                            Created a UNet architecture from scratch  using tensorflow  to semantically segment the  images , this was used in detecting the brain tumours . Additionally a half UNET model was also created which does not have enough encoder stack as compared to unet but is light. <br>

                            Created  a Deep neural network which consists of the dense connected layers and the convolutional neural networks , where the inputs were the images of the hand in case of the indian sign language , and then on the basis of the training of the networks based on the images and the labels , the labels were predicted for the test cases . <br>

                            Currently working on a  custom object detection model whose basic idea is  that we would search the object at different levels after creating the image filters at different levels , this idea is similar to the spatial pyramid pooling ,and the squeeze and the excitation model , which apart from the attention alos uses spatial pyramid pooling of the features , which is basically the features adapted in various filter sizes. <br>

                        <li>
                            Made a programme in the Computer vision class , which basically tracks the  iris of the person and then moves the cursor according to the motion of the iris , we also added an additional feature of taking a snapshot or clicking using the blink of the eye . <br>
